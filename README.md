# Eureka

## Instructions  

 1. Clone the repo with ```git clone https://github.com/AUBGTheHUB/Eureka.git```.  
 2. Get Django and all dependencies using ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```. It's highly suggested that you do this in a venv.  
 3. You can run the test server by using:

```bash
$ python manage.py runserver
```

 In case you have both Python 2 and 3, you should use:  

```bash
$ python3 manage.py runserver
```

Your Python version should be at least 3.5 for this version of Django.
